# CheckingIfTwoHalvesOfAWordArePalindromes

In this program, the user must enter a word or set of symbols of even length (Example: anna!@@!). 
If it is not of even length, then the user will be prompted to input a new word. 

After this, the program will break this string into two substrings. Then, it will check if both substrings are palindromes.

   (Example: anna!@@! can be evenly split into "anna" and "!@@!". These two substrings are indeed palindromes.)


If so, you will see an output of "YES". If the two substrings are not palindromes, you will see an output of "NO".
